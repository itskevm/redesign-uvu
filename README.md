# Redesign UVU
## Overview

This is a lone page that was "redesigned" from a layout standpoint. [The original page](https://www.uvu.edu/advancement/ways-to-give/) I chose to redesign is found under UVU's Institutional Advancement department. This was produced in only a 24 hour period where changes were prioritized by the following: 
- Simplicity
- Visual appeal
- Authentic feel
- Adherence to current design guidelines

## Change Summary
| Change | Purpose |
| ------ | ------ |
| Banner background image | Nature is the ultimate sign of giving and bearing fruit, meaning it can be more related to donations and giving instead of showing a blurred picture of the campus itself. |
| Give Now button | It is placed right at the top for easier access and again later on in the section that explains how to proceed with a donation. |
| _Financial Donations_ and _More Ways_ placement | The two different sections make the page long, however, when in desktop mode, they are displayed side by side, which allows for desktop users to get to the final section of the page a little quicker.|
| Image and text cards | Some pages use clickable  _cards_ that link to another page for explanation. The style of these is generally the same, but I implemented the behaviour and look of the _cards_ on this page because it looks better on any text length |
| How to Proceed section | I added a section name since the last part of this page did not have one, which also perfectly informs the user what the next step is in the donation process. |
| Donation methods | Removed the light green border and background from these and listed them one by one horizontally, with another Give Now button easily accessible. This change encourages a user to act quicker if they are ready to donate |
